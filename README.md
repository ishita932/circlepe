Intergalactic Trade Network - Backend
This repository contains the backend for the Intergalactic Trade Network, which manages trade transactions, space cargo shipments, and inventory at space stations across multiple planets. The system supports real-time updates and high-volume data transactions using a combination of MongoDB, and mysql.

Design Decisions and Architecture
1. Architectural Overview
The system is designed using a microservice approach, where each feature is encapsulated in a dedicated service (Trade, Cargo, Inventory) to ensure scalability and maintainability. The services communicate with databases.

Key components:

API Gateway: Routes all client requests to respective services (trade, cargo, inventory).
MongoDB: Non-relational database for handling high-throughput data like cargo shipments and space station inventories.
MySQL: Relational database for trade transactions, which require structured data storage.
Express.js: Web framework for handling HTTP requests and responses.

2. Database Choices
MySQL: Chosen for trade transactions because of its relational data structure and the need for consistency in trade data.
MongoDB: Ideal for cargo shipments and inventory due to its ability to handle unstructured, high-throughput data and horizontal scalability.

Tech Stack
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
Express.js: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for cargo shipments and space station inventories.
MySQL: Relational database for handling trade transactions.
